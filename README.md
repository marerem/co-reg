# Co-Registration of Coronary Artery Imaging

It's algorithm with graphical user interface (GUI) that assists in co-registering two sequences of images by aligning one sequence to another based on user-selected checkpoints.

# Motiation

To diagnose heart disease, doctors use a catheter with a camera to examine the coronary arteries. Imagine a stent procedure that widens an artery. Before and after the procedure, doctors receive two sets of images: one from before and one from after. These sets start and end at different points, have different angles due to the catheter's movement, and contain a different number of frames per time. Manually aligning these images would be quite challenging and time-consuming. But don't worry! Let's look at a user-friendly GUI that can help easily and quickly align them, making the process much smoother and stress-free for everyone involved.
